# Travel Planning App - Functional Specification

## Project Overview

A web-based travel planning application that allows users to manage trips and check weather conditions for their destinations. Built for rapid development and demonstration purposes with a focus on core functionality and modern user experience.

## Core Features

### 1. Trip Management
**Priority**: Core Feature
**Description**: Create, view, edit, and delete travel trips with essential information.

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to create a new trip with name, destination, start date, and end date
- As a user, I want to view all my created trips in a list/card format
- As a user, I want to edit trip details to update plans
- As a user, I want to delete trips I no longer need
- As a user, I want to see trip duration calculated automatically

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Trip creation form with validation (required fields, date logic)
- Trip list displays all trips with key information
- Edit functionality updates trip in real-time
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Form validation prevents invalid dates (end before start)

### 2. Weather Checker
**Priority**: Core Feature  
**Description**: Display current weather information for trip destinations.

**User Stories**:

GET    /api/trips/{trip_id}    # Get specific trip
PUT    /api/trips/{trip_id}    # Update trip
DELETE /api/trips/{trip_id}    # Delete trip
```

### Weather Endpoints

```json
POST /api/trips
{
  "name": "Paris Adventure",
  "destination": "Paris, France", 
  "start_date": "2024-06-01",
  "end_date": "2024-06-07",

  "name": "Paris Adventure",
  "destination": "Paris, France",
  "start_date": "2024-06-01", 
  "end_date": "2024-06-07",
  "notes": "Honeymoon trip",
  "duration_days": 6,
  "created_at": "2024-05-20T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Get Weather**:
```json
GET /api/weather/Paris,%20France

Response: 200 OK
{
  "location": "Paris, France",
  "temperature": 22,
  "condition": "Partly Cloudy",
  "humidity": 65,
  "wind_speed": 12,
  "updated_at": "2024-05-20T14:30:00Z"

## User Interface Requirements

### Layout & Navigation
- Single-page application with sections for trips and weather
- Responsive design working on desktop and mobile
- Clean, modern interface using Tailwind CSS
- Modal dialogs for trip creation/editing forms

### Interactive Elements
- Toast notifications for user feedback (success/error messages)
- Loading states for API calls (weather fetching, form submissions)
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Form validation with inline error messages

### Trip Management UI
- Trip cards/list with key information displayed
- Add Trip button triggering modal form
- Edit/Delete actions on each trip card
- Date picker for trip dates
- Form validation and error display

### Weather Display UI
- Weather widget showing current conditions
- Integration with trip cards to show destination weather
- Weather icons/visual indicators for conditions
- Error states for failed weather API calls

## Data Validation

### Trip Data
- Name: Required, 1-100 characters
- Destination: Required, valid location string
- Start Date: Required, cannot be in the past
- End Date: Required, must be after start date
- Notes: Optional, max 500 characters

### Weather Data
- Location validation before API call
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Cache weather data for reasonable time (30 minutes)

## Error Handling

### User-Facing Errors
- Form validation errors shown inline
- API errors displayed via toast notifications
- Network errors with retry functionality
- Invalid location errors for weather requests

### Error Messages
- "Please enter a valid destination"
- "End date must be after start date"
- "Unable to fetch weather data. Please try again."
- "Trip deleted successfully"
- "Trip created successfully"

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- Trip CRUD operations: < 200ms
- Weather API calls: < 3 seconds
- Page load: < 2 seconds

### Data Management
- Weather data cached for 30 minutes
- Optimistic UI updates for trip operations
- Graceful degradation if weather API unavailable
